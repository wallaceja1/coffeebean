The title of this map is "The World's Coffee Bean Producers by Tons, 2018". This project shows the global leaders in Coffee Bean Production for 2018 in metric tons. Most of the worlds largest producers are located along the equatorial region and are home to wet, tropical climates. Countries outside of this region typically do not have any coffee bean production or an insignificant amount and thus were not included in the data. This project is a proportional symbol map that utilizes circle markers to display the relative coffee bean production of the worlds largest coffee bean producers. The data was originally collected by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and was formatted within an Excel spreadsheet alongside each nation's geographical center point as Lat/Long coordinates. The Excel spreadsheet was then converted to a geoJSON. The map was then built with Leaflet and jQuery within Atom. The basemap is property of OpenStreetMap.
